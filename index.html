                  I am really satisfied with how my last 2 years have passed. But, for my third year to be special, it

                  <i>Student dorm</i>
                  <br> There's something about living in a student dorm that changes you as a person. It changes the way you
                  <i>think</i>, but in a
                  <b>much better way</b>. It shows you what life can be, once you're not bound to just your house, a few friends
                  and 2 or 3 locations where all of you go to hangout. Being an introvert for 20 years, the dorm started
                  pulling out the extroverted side in me, which was burried deep down.
                  <br> And I liked it.
                  <br> Then, I
                  <u> I bought a tablet </u>. Now, that changed the way I spend my free time. I would download vocational e-books
                  from the internet and read them for at least 3 or 4 hours a day. It expanded my horizon forever, and improved
                  the way I think.
                  <p>I went from doing OK in college to acing my programming projects - and always coming up with something
                    new and 'original' - something that wasn't asked for, but improved the project.</p>
                  I was also able to help out anyone (in my group) who was stuck, recognizing the bugs in their code almost instantly. I gathered
                  experience.
                  <br>

                <div class="goals" id="goals-2016">
                  <h2>2016</h2>
                  <i>America</i>
                  <br> Then, out of nowhere, I went to a Work&Travel agency and signed up for the program. I signed up for working
                  in a hotel (
                  <a href="http://www.snowking.com/" target="_blank">Snow King Resort</a>) as a housekeeper, but that quickly evolved up to me being in the front desk team.
                  Maybe because of my language skills, maybe because of my charm. :) Jokes aside - whatever the reason was,
                  I then had the chance to speak to hundreds - or maybe thousands? - of people (guests).
                  <br> And. It. Was. Amazing.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br> A lot of other great things happened, but those above are the highlights. Still, I think leaving 2017
                  to chance is not a good idea, because I really have to accomplish something amazing to outdo the last 2
                  years. And that is why I think setting some goals would be a good idea.
                  <b>However</b> they need to be very
                  <i>specific</i>. Having unspecific goals doesn't lead anywhere.
